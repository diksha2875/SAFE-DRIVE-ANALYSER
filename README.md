Technologies used : 
Python, Libraries- dlibs, CV2, imutils and numpy 
● Developed an OS-independent software solution, allowing seamless implementation across various operating systems with 98% accuracy.

● Implemented algorithms utilizing face anatomy analysis and Euclidean distance measurements for accurate driver status determination.

● Integrated an alert system that notifies the user when necessary based on the detected driver's status, ensuring prompt action can be taken.

NOVELTY OF THE PROJECT
We used the concept of face recognition and idle alert alarms (A software which recognises if a person is drowsy or not) to make this safe drive analyser.
Moreover, Euclidean Distance is used to gauge the drowsiness status of a person.
